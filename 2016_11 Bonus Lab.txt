Labs for today
Build HTML page with as many of standard items as possible
On form submit, use preventDefault to stop the form submitting.
Do form validation on all of the input items in Javascript
Validate the items
If NOT OK : RED BORDER ROUND FIELD??? AND/OR MESSAGE IN A DIV
Let the user know the form is OK
Wait 2 seconds using setTimeout
Save the data to a JSON object
Save data to localStorage
On page load
Check localStorage
If object exists load the data
Console.log the data
Prefill (use JSON.parse) at least the text fields on the screen - can you get all of the elements to set their data from the data stored in localStorage?
Bonus : Create buttons 1 and 2 which will refer to two different customer records.  Create an array which will hold two JSON object records.  Button 1 will update record 1 and Button 2 will update record2

	var myArray= [ obj1,obj2 ]

	obj1 = { }
	obj2 = { }
